### User Story 1
As a user, I want to enter a written description into the application so that the system can automatically generate a 3D world matching my input.

### User Story 2
As a user, I want the system to identify objects, terrain, and lighting from my description so that the generated world feels accurate and immersive.

### User Story 3
As a user, I want to navigate and explore the generated 3D environment so that I can interact with the space as if it were real.

### User Story 4
As a user, I want the application to allow me to refine or edit parts of the generated world so that I can customize details to better fit my vision.

### User Story 5
As a user, I want to save and reload my generated worlds so that I can return to them later or share them with others.
