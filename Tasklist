## Project-Specific Tasks

1. Research natural language processing methods for parsing user text descriptions. (Responsible: Z)  
2. Design the text parser module to extract objects, terrain, and environment details from input. (Responsible: Z)  
3. Develop the text parser component and test it with sample descriptions. (Responsible: Z)  
4. Design the world generator subsystem with object placement, terrain builder, and lighting system modules. (Responsible: Z)  
5. Develop the object placement module for generating 3D assets in the environment. (Responsible: Z)  
6. Develop the terrain builder module for creating landscapes and surfaces. (Responsible: Z)  
7. Develop the lighting system to simulate natural and artificial light in generated environments. (Responsible: Z)  
8. Design the 3D renderer subsystem including rendering engine, physics engine, and interaction layer. (Responsible: Z)  
9. Implement the rendering engine to visualize generated 3D environments. (Responsible: Z)  
10. Implement the physics engine to handle movement, collisions, and interactions. (Responsible: Z)  
11. Implement the interaction layer so users can navigate and interact with generated worlds. (Responsible: Z)  
12. Design the user interface for entering descriptions and exploring generated worlds. (Responsible: Z)  
13. Develop the user interface for input, editing, saving, and loading worlds. (Responsible: Z)  
14. Integrate text parser, world generator, renderer, and UI into a cohesive system. (Responsible: Z)  
15. Test the system end-to-end using a variety of sample descriptions. (Responsible: Z)  
16. Refine modules based on testing feedback to improve accuracy and performance. (Responsible: Z)  
17. Document the system design, architecture, and usage instructions. (Responsible: Z)
