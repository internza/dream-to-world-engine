# ABET Concerns

The Dream to World Engine introduces several important considerations related to ethics, safety, privacy, security, and broader social impact. Since the system converts natural language prompts into three dimensional scenes, it handles user intent, creative content, and real time rendering. Each part carries responsibilities that guide the design of the project.

Ethical use is a primary concern because generative tools can be misused to create harmful or misleading content. The system must avoid supporting prompts that promote dangerous behavior or inappropriate environments. Clear communication of capabilities and limits is necessary so users understand what the tool is meant for and what it cannot safely generate.

Privacy is another concern because user prompts can contain sensitive information. Prompts should never be stored in a way that exposes data to anyone outside the system. Local processing or secure handling ensures that personal content is not logged or shared. Any future use of cloud models must include safe data handling practices and strong access control.

Security matters because the engine runs user supplied input through a processing pipeline. The system must defend against unexpected or malicious inputs that could break rendering, overload resources, or exploit any part of the code. Input validation and controlled handling of generated scene objects help reduce risk.

There are also safety considerations related to how the system displays scenes. The engine must avoid generating camera placements, lighting effects, or motion patterns that can cause discomfort or disorientation. Features that promote stable navigation and clear visibility support user well being.

Social impact is another dimension. Tools that generate worlds can influence creativity and learning. The project should encourage exploration and constructive outcomes. The engine should also remain accessible to users with different skill levels so it can benefit a broader audience.

Overall the project aims to build a system that is safe, secure, and ethically responsible. These concerns shape design choices and will continue to guide development in future phases.
