# Project Description

The Dream to World Engine is a system that converts natural language prompts into interactive three dimensional scenes. The project explores how text interpretation, data modeling, and real time rendering can work together to create a fast and intuitive way to generate visual environments. The goal is to give users a direct path from an idea to a functional scene without manual modeling.

The system begins by processing a prompt and identifying the objects, structures, and relationships that belong in the scene. These details are mapped into a structured world model that defines placement, hierarchy, behaviors, and visual attributes. The engine then uses a rendering layer to create the environment with models, lighting, and camera controls.

During this term the focus has been on system architecture, user story development, and the initial pipeline for text input, world generation, and scene visualization. The work also includes early navigation controls, concept designs for model placement, and a framework for future growth into physics, animation, and interactive behaviors.

This project aims to create a foundation that can scale into a larger platform for world building, rapid prototyping, and creative exploration.
