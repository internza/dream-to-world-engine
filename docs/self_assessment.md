## Zyad Alkurdi

This semester I focused on building the core ideas and structure of the Dream to World Engine. I worked on defining the system architecture, shaping the natural language to scene pipeline, creating early design diagrams, and building the foundation for the rendering layer. Most of my effort went into planning how the system scales, how components communicate, and how the user experience should feel from input to final scene.

I contributed heavily to user stories, task planning, and the level based diagrams. I also explored different ways to manage world data, generate scene layouts, and create responsive camera movement. These tasks helped me understand the full path from concept to working design.

Throughout the term I improved in breaking large ideas into small achievable tasks, documenting decisions, and keeping the project organized. I also strengthened my skills in graphics programming and system planning. I feel confident about my progress and the direction of the project.

I expect to apply everything I learned this semester to build more advanced features in the next phase, including improved generation logic, dynamic behaviors, and deeper integration with model rendering and interaction.
