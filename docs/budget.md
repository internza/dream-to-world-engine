# Budget and Expenses

The Dream to World Engine project has not required any spending during the Fall term. No hardware components, paid software licenses, cloud services, or physical materials have been purchased.

## Current Expenses
There have been no financial expenses to date.

## Donations and Value
The project uses resources that carry real value but are provided at no cost.

• Visual Studio Code  
• GitHub Student Developer Pack  
• Three.js open source library  
• Node.js and npm  
• Free generative model endpoints used for prototyping  

All items above are free to use and do not incur a cost for the team.  
Their combined monetary value is estimated at one hundred to two hundred dollars if purchased individually, but no transactions were required.

## Summary
The project currently operates with a zero dollar active budget, and no spending is planned for the remainder of the Fall term. All development work relies on free and open tools.
