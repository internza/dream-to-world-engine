**# Project Abstract**

The Dream to World Engine transforms natural language into interactive three dimensional scenes. Users describe any environment or concept in plain text and the system generates a structured world with models, behaviors, and navigation. This engine blends AI, procedural design, and real time rendering to create a fast, intuitive way to bring ideas into visual form.
